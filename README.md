# CanvasCraft

A creative portfolio project built for the Appwrite Sites Hackathon — a modern, responsive web app demonstrating Appwrite-powered authentication, data, and storage integrations.

## Key Features
- Appwrite-powered backend: authentication, databases, and storage
- Responsive, modern UI with smooth interactions
- Secure authentication flows using Appwrite Auth
- Real-time or dynamic data handling via Appwrite Databases
- Easy deployment to Appwrite, Vercel, or Netlify

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (modern patterns)
- Backend: Appwrite (Cloud)
- Deployment: Appwrite
- Tools: GitHub, VS Code, Framer Motion (for animations) and Appwrite

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArhanAnsari/CanvasCraft.git
cd CanvasCraft
npm install
```

Create an Appwrite project and add credentials to a `.env` file in the repo root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
```

Run locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# Open: http://localhost:3000
```

## Deployment
- Build and deploy to Vercel or Netlify with the same environment variables.
- For Appwrite-hosted deployments, follow Appwrite Sites documentation to connect your app.

## Screenshots
(Place project screenshots in `/docs` or `./screenshots` and reference them here for a visual preview.)

## Learnings
- Implemented Appwrite Auth flows and secure session handling
- Designed database schemas and client-side database interactions
- Improved UI/UX with responsive layout and subtle animations

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Appwrite for the backend platform, the hackathon organizers, and the open-source community for inspiration.
